  annotator: enabled generation of orthologous gene annotations for all searchable species
    implemented compression of XREF_SOURCE and NOTES fields

Mar 31, 2022
  disabled generation of gene orthologous annotations -- transitive annotation pipeline (TAP) will take care of it
    and since TAP is also consolidating annotations by XREF_SRC field, this will result in significant reduction
    of ISO annotations in general

Apr 10, 2020
  loader: variant last-modified-date is set to SYSDATE only if any of variant properties or any associated data
    like aliases, gene associations, hgvs names, xdb ids or map positions have been changed;
    otherwise it is left unchanged
    note: previously the logic was flawed

 -annotator v.1.1.1: carpe-novo compliant annotator

ClinVar pipeline has been updated to be carpenovo-compliant. Per Brandon, they are loading only variants
 of specific 4 types having positions on GRChm37 assembly map. After running the ClinVar pipeline:

100,340 – ClinVar variants loaded, out of which:
  95,419 – variants of types: ‘single nucleotide variant’,’insertion’,’deletion’,’duplication’
 88,922 – variants with carpenovo compliant type having positions on GRChm37 assembly

We have generated annotations for those 88,922 variants. We used variant MedGen id, and ClinVar file with mapping of MedGen id to OMIM phenotype id.

28,046 variant annotations were generated
  23,171 unique variants were annotated
  2,307 unique RDO terms were annotated to variants
50,323 related gene annotations to rat,mouse,human were made

   started work on alternate matching of condition-name to disease-term

  -qc -- added matching of omim id to mesh ids through umls database;
   that substantially increased the number of annotations

ver 1.0.2, Apr 4, 2014
  -fully working pipeline; fixed the parsing logic for extraction of variant names;
   added parsing and loading of 'SNOMED CT' ids

ver 1.0, Feb 11, 2014
